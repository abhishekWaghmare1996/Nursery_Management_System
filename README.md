# Nursery-Management-System
Summary-

The Plant Nursery Management System (NMS) is a database-driven application built with Python and SQLite. It enables the customer to create an account and access Plant database features such as purchasing various types of plants and receiving a final bill slip for the same. If an existing customer operates NMS, the NMS will directly grant the customer a 5% discount on the final bill. The NMS can also be managed by staff. Staff can check on the availability of plants. Aside from that, they can update the price and quantity of plants available. They also have the ability to add and remove plants from the database. Staff also has access to customer data such as their name and phone number. On the terminal, the NMS also displays random quotes.
